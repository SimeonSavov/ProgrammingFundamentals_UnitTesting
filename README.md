# QA-Engineering

Welcome to my repository for the 'Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing' course in C# at SoftUni. Here, I will be sharing my exercises and projects.

## About the First Section - Conditional Statements (Lesson 1)

In the first section of this course, I delved into the essential concepts of conditional statements in C#. Here's a summary of what I've learned and practiced:

1. **Basic If-Else Statements:** I grasped the usage of the `if` statement to create conditional logic in my programs. This allowed me to make decisions based on conditions, and I honed my skills in using `else` to handle alternative outcomes.

2. **Switch-Case Statements:** I explored the efficiency of the `switch-case` statement, which streamlined handling multiple conditional branches based on the value of an expression.

3. **Comparison and Logical Operators:** I refreshed my understanding of various comparison operators (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<`) and logical operators (e.g., `&&`, `||`) to construct complex conditional expressions.

4. **Nested Conditional Statements:** I practiced using nested `if-else` statements to manage multiple levels of conditions, empowering me to create more sophisticated logic.

5. **Validation and Error Handling:** I mastered the art of incorporating validation checks into my programs to ensure that user inputs are valid. I also learned how to display meaningful error messages when necessary.

6. **Calculations and Output:** I applied conditional statements to perform calculations and generate output messages based on specific conditions.
