## About the First Section - Conditional Statements (Lesson 1)

In the first section of this course, I delved into the essential concepts of conditional statements in C#. Here's a summary of what I've learned and practiced:

In the third section of this course, I further expanded my knowledge of conditional statements in C#, delving into more advanced and intricate scenarios. Here's an overview of what I've covered:

1. **Conditional Logic Mastery:** I continued to refine my skills in crafting sophisticated conditional logic using `if-else if-else` statements. This allowed me to handle complex decision-making processes with ease.

2. **Nested Conditional Statements:** I built upon my understanding of nested conditional statements, enabling me to manage intricate, multi-level conditions effectively.

3. **String Manipulation:** I learned how to manipulate strings using conditional statements, giving me the ability to create dynamic and context-aware output messages.

4. **Numeric Precision:** I deepened my knowledge of numeric comparisons and precision, which was crucial for implementing various mathematical operations and calculations in my programs.

5. **Validation Strategies:** I explored advanced validation strategies, ensuring that my programs handle a wide range of user inputs gracefully and securely.

## About the Fourth Section - For Loops (Lesson 4)

In the fourth section of this course, I delved into the powerful world of `for` loops in C#. Here's an overview of what I've covered:

1. **Number Range Iteration:** I learned how to use a `for` loop to iterate through a range of numbers effectively. This provided a foundation for various numerical applications.

2. **Number Sum Calculation:** I developed programs to calculate the sum of numbers within specific ranges. This improved my understanding of arithmetic operations and loop structures.

3. **Countdown Timers:** I created countdown timer programs, such as an exam countdown. These programs involved user input, enhancing my input handling skills.

## About the Fifth Lesson - While Loops (Lesson 5)

In the fifth lesson of this course, I explored the versatility of `while` loops in C# programming. Here's an overview of what I've covered:

1. **Countdown with a While Loop:** I created a program that counts down from a user-provided integer using a `while` loop. The program continuously prompts the user for input and displays the countdown until reaching 1.

2. **Validation Loop:** I developed a program that ensures user input falls within a specified range. It repeatedly prompts for input until a valid number within the range is provided.

3. **Pattern-Based Number Generation:** I crafted a program that generates a sequence of numbers based on a specific pattern using a `while` loop. The user specifies an upper limit, and the program generates numbers following the pattern until reaching or exceeding the limit.

4. **Sum of Digits:** I designed a program that calculates the sum of the digits of a positive integer. The program uses a `while` loop to iteratively extract and sum each digit.

5. **Interactive Numeric Manipulation:** I created a program that allows users to manipulate a numeric value using custom commands ("Inc" and "Dec"). The program continues to process commands until the user inputs "End," at which point it displays the final manipulated value.

## About the Sixth Lesson - For and While Loops (Lesson 6)

In the sixth lesson of this course, we explored the capabilities of both `for` and `while` loops in C# programming. This lesson allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of iterative control structures. Below is a summary of the tasks we completed and the key concepts we've learned:

1. **Power Calculation with a For Loop:** We used a `for` loop to calculate the result of raising a given number to a certain power. Users provided the base number and exponent, and the program computed and displayed the result. This task emphasized the repetitive nature of `for` loops for mathematical computations.

2. **Multiplication Table with a For Loop:** We utilized a `for` loop to generate a multiplication table for a user-provided number from 1 to 10. The program calculated and displayed the products for each factor in the table. This task illustrated how `for` loops can efficiently handle repetitive patterns.

3. **Percentage Calculation with a For Loop:** We employed a `for` loop to calculate the percentage of numbers divisible by 2, 3, and 4 within a set of user-input numbers. The program computed and displayed the percentages for each divisibility criterion, highlighting the utility of `for` loops in data analysis.

4. **Checking Special Numbers with a While Loop:** We used a `while` loop to check if a user-input number is "special," meaning it is divisible by all of its individual digits. The task demonstrated the flexibility of `while` loops in handling iterative processes that may not have a fixed number of iterations.

5. **Price Increase on Stop Number with a While Loop:** We employed a `while` loop to continuously read numbers from the user until a specified stop number was encountered. Once the stop number was found, the program calculated and displayed a 20% price increase over the previous number. This task highlighted the interactive and dynamic nature of `while` loops.

### Key Concepts Learned:

- **For Loops:** We learned that `for` loops are particularly useful for situations where the number of iterations is known in advance, such as iterating over a range of numbers or performing a fixed number of operations.

- **While Loops:** We discovered that `while` loops are versatile for scenarios where the number of iterations may vary based on user input or dynamic conditions. They allow for interactive and adaptive control flow.

- **Mathematical Computations:** We applied loops for mathematical calculations, including exponentiation, multiplication tables, and percentage calculations.

- **Data Analysis:** We used loops to analyze data by counting and calculating percentages based on specific criteria.

These tasks collectively provided a solid foundation in using `for` and `while` loops for a wide range of programming challenges.
